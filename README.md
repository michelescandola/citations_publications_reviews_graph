by Michele Scandola, 2022 michele.scandola@univr.it

Simple code to create a graphical representation of:

- number of publications from Google Scholar
- number of citations from Google Scholar
- number of reviews from Publons

over the years.

It also includes h-index, i10-index, total number of reviews.

It is necessary to modify some partes of the code to obtain your data, but everything should be clearly commented
